# FileTransfer
## About
<p>This is a python program that allows a user to download files from a server.<p>
<p>I made this program so that I could download files from my server to my laptop, without needing a cli.<p>
<p>It was also so I could learn python networking, and not rely on tools like ftp.<p>

## Features
- The Client and Server automatically connect once the client is started, once configured.
- Allows you to download both files and folders while keeping their integrity

## Client
<p>For the client side all you need to do is download the client and run the python code using python3.<p>
<p>The only major dependency is tkinter, apart from that there are no other downloadable python modules needed.<p>

## Server
<p>The server side is the same way. Download the file and run the program using python3 and the server should be up and running<p>
